### Note:- You can easily pass the real AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam (CLF-C01) when you are constantly scoring 75-80% in any of these practice tests. 
 My advice is to buy 2 practice test either (Jon Bonso + Neal Davis) or (Jon Bonso + Stephane Maarek) so that you have more number of questions to practice.

## Note:-

1.If at any point of time you find yourself unsure about your progress and feel the need for more time, you can postpone your AWS Exam Date. But don't postpone (unless you have some strong personal reason to rescheduling) try to be fully prepared in second rescheduling date. 

Every time if you reschedule your date then your confidence level keeps on shrinking and when you finally decide to appear for the exam then in panic on exam day you are unable to answer even simple question so Try not to prepare yourself too much. Follow the simple, traditional way of preparing for the exam.

2.Before experimenting with AWS, it's very important to be sure that you know what is [free](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all) and what isn't. Relevant Free Tier FAQs can be [found here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier-faqs/)

3. Udemy often has their courses go on sale from time to time. It might be worth waiting to purchase you will get 90% discount in these courses
